# Economic-Analysis-of-Government-Spending

**Project:** Economic Analysis of Government Spending

**Objective:** Analyze government spending data to explore patterns, relationships with GDP per capita growth across G20 economies, and its alignment with policy declarations and actual budgetary allocations. Further, investigate any additional associations between government spending and broader economic activity.

**Dataset:**
- SAM.gov (US)
- Open Tenders and TED EUropa (EU)
- E-procurement (India)

**Tasks:**
1. Data Acquisition and Preliminary Analysis
    * Extract and clean government spending data from the aforementioned platforms.
    * Conduct a preliminary analysis to understand data characteristics, dimensions, and potential issues.

2. Time-Series Analysis
    * Construct daily and/or monthly time-series charts to illustrate government spending over an extended period.
    * Identify any discernible patterns or anomalies in the spending data across different sectors.

3. Sector-Wise Analysis
    * Evaluate government spending within various sectors to pinpoint instances of budget booms and busts.
    * Compare and contrast spending trends across different sectors.

4. Policy and Spending Misalignment Analysis
    * Investigate and analyze the alignment between policy declarations, budget allocations, and actual spending.

5. Economic Impact Analysis
    * Explore the relationship between government spending and GDP per capita growth for G20 economies utilizing a cross-country panel approach.
    * Examine any correlations or disparities between government spending and broader economic activity.

6. Machine Learning Modelling
    * Develop a predictive model using machine learning to forecast future spending trends and their potential impact on economic indicators.
